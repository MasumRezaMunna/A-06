1. The difference between var, let and const is given below:
var is function scoped, re-declarable and old.
let is block scoped, can be updated but not re-declarable.
const is block scoped, cannot be updated or re-declared.

2. The difference between map(), forEach() and filter() is given below:
map() returns a new array with modified values.
forEach() runs code for each item but returns nothing.
filter() returns a new array with items that match a condition.

3. Arrow functions are a shorter way to write functions in ES6. They use => instead of function. They do not have their own this, so they inherit it from the parent scope.

4. Destructuring assignment works in ES6 in a quick way to take values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables.

5. Template literals in ES6 are strings written with bacticks (``) instead of quotes unlike string concatenation which uses +-. They allow multi line strings and string interpolation using ${}.
